# Project Roles and Audience

This project is maintained by a single owner who collaborates with AI assistants to plan and implement work. There are
no external stakeholders who participate in day-to-day decision making; instead, decisions optimise for future open
source consumers of the iCLI library.

## Roles

- **Maintainer (human owner)** — Defines the roadmap, approves research hand-offs, and reviews assistant output. The
  maintainer may execute supporting research when the assistant requests it.
- **AI assistants** — Execute tasks inside the repository: planning, analysis, documentation, implementation, and
  testing. Assistants should flag uncertainties to the maintainer rather than assuming additional stakeholders exist.
- **Future consumers** — Developers who will adopt the released library. They do not provide direct feedback during
  development; their needs are inferred from roadmap goals and captured requirements.

## Expectations for assistants

- Treat the maintainer as the sole decision maker. When instructions mention “stakeholders”, substitute with the
  maintainer unless a document explicitly calls out future consumers for context.
- Capture audience considerations (e.g., developer ergonomics, cross-platform support) in requirements and documentation
  so the open source community can benefit later, but do not wait for external approvals.
- Document any assumptions about future consumer needs inside task dossiers or requirements briefs to aid future
  revisions.

Refer to this file whenever templates or checklists ask for stakeholders or reviewers; the maintainer fulfils that role.
