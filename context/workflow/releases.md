# Release Checklist

- Use semantic version tags (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
- Validate Linux, macOS, and Windows compatibility before tagging.
- Document release steps and publication commands here when the process is established.
- Record platform-specific issues in the backlog or roadmap so follow-up work is tracked.
