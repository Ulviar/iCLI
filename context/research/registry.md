# Code Research Registry

## Usage Guidance
- Review this registry before each task to understand which research artifacts are available and decide which ones to
revisit in depth.
- Open the specific analysis files only when their topics align with the problem at hand; avoid re-reading the entire
directory unless a task explicitly requires a full survey.
- Update this registry whenever new research documents are added or existing ones change scope.

## Entries
- `kotlin-solution-audit.md` — Findings from the Phase 1 audit of the legacy Kotlin implementation, including reusable
ideas, pain points, and capability gaps.
