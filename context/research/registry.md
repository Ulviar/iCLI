# Code Research Registry

## Usage Guidance
- Review this registry before each task to understand which research artifacts are available and decide which ones to
  revisit in depth.
- Open the specific analysis files only when their topics align with the problem at hand; avoid re-reading the entire
  directory unless a task explicitly requires a full survey.
- Update this registry whenever new research documents are added or existing ones change scope.

## Entries
- [kotlin-solution-audit.md](experiments/kotlin-solution-audit.md) — Findings from the Phase 1 audit of the legacy
  Kotlin implementation, including reusable ideas, pain points, and capability gaps.
- [icli-execution-engine-benchmarks.md](icli-execution-engine-benchmarks.md) — Comparative study of process execution
  libraries across ecosystems, capturing PTY, I/O, cancellation, and pooling insights for iCLI architecture planning.
- [pty-dependency-comparison.md](pty-dependency-comparison.md) — Snapshot of PTY-capable JVM libraries (pty4j, Commons
  Exec, JNA, Jansi, JLine) with licensing, maintenance, and Windows strategy notes; feeds interactive session planning
  tasks.
