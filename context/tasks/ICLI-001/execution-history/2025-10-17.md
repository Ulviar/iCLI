# Execution History — ICLI-001 — 2025-10-17

- **Author:** AI Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Documented the assistant-managed workflow, created supporting templates, updated backlog formatting,
  codified the human-in-the-loop research process, and refreshed cross-references.

## Implementation notes
- Refined `context/tasks/README.md` to mandate Markdown-linked knowledge references and document the human-in-the-loop
  research hand-off protocol.
- Added `context/tasks/README.md` describing lifecycle stages, dossier structure, templates, feedback-loop guidance, and the archive strategy for completed dossiers.
- Created templates for dossiers, analysis logs, research requests, and execution histories under
  `context/tasks/templates/`.
- Introduced example dossier and logs in `context/tasks/examples/sample-task/`.
- Updated `context/tasks/backlog.md` schema and migrated the ICLI-001 row to the new format.
- Converted the ICLI-001 dossier to the template-based structure with analysis and execution logs.
- Linked the workflow from `context/README.md`, contributor guidelines, and collaboration workflow documentation.
- Added `context/tasks/archive/README.md` and template sections documenting the archival checklist.

## Tests & verification
- Manual review of Markdown formatting and internal links.

## Documentation updates
- Multiple Markdown files across `context/tasks/`, `context/README.md`,
  `context/guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md`, and `context/workflow/collaboration.md`.

## Follow-up & risks
- Await decision on archiving policy for completed dossiers.
- Future tasks should validate the workflow during use and refine templates as needed.
