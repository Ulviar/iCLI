# ICLI-003 — Catalogue Execution Use Cases & Constraints

## Status
- **Lifecycle stage:** Planning
- **Overall status:** Backlog
- **Last updated:** 2025-10-18
- **Owner:** Unassigned

## Overview
- **Objective:** Compile a vetted list of process execution use cases and non-functional constraints drawn from existing
  audits, roadmap notes, and requirements briefs.
- **Definition of Done:** Use case catalogue published under `context/roadmap/`; constraint summary added to the task
  dossier; references to all source materials recorded.
- **Constraints:** Leverage current repository documentation; request additional research only if maintained sources are
  insufficient.
- **Roles to notify:** Maintainer (project owner).

## Planning
- **Scope summary:** Synthesize execution scenarios (single-run, interactive, pooled) and associated constraints needed
  for architecture planning.
- **Proposed deliverables:** Roadmap document or appendix listing use cases; updated dossier notes citing constraint
  priorities.
- **Open questions / risks:** Need to validate whether legacy Kotlin audit covers all maintainer scenarios; gaps may
  require follow-up interviews.
- **Backlog link:** [context/tasks/backlog.md](../backlog.md)
