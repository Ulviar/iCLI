# Analysis Log — ICLI-003 — 2025-10-18

- **Author:** Assistant (Codex)
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Review existing repository knowledge to scope the execution use case catalogue and constraint summary.

## Knowledge consulted
- [Execution requirements](../../roadmap/execution-requirements.md) — Clarified maintainer scenarios and constraint
  categories for single-run, interactive, and pooled execution modes.
- [Process integration KB](../../knowledge-base/operations/Java%20Terminal%20%26%20Process%20Integration.md) — Provided
  PTY expectations, IO pumping patterns, and signal handling details to map into constraints.
- [Legacy audit](../../research/experiments/kotlin-solution-audit.md) — Highlighted legacy pain points (busy loops,
  charset issues, command rigidity) that must be addressed in the new catalogue.
- [Project roadmap](../../roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Noted roadmap emphasis on shells, REPLs, and pooled workers that
  require explicit coverage.
- [Project conventions](../../guidelines/icli/project-conventions.md) — Reinforced concurrent draining, PTY preference,
  and UTF-8 handling as ground rules for constraint summarisation.

## Repository inspection
- `context/tasks/archive/ICLI-002/` — Reviewed prior requirements task history to ensure continuity with the new
  catalogue deliverable location.
- `context/tasks/backlog.md` — Confirmed backlog expectations and status before starting execution.

## Gaps & questions
- No additional maintainer memos were found; proceed assuming documented scenarios are complete. Capture new cases if
  discovered later.

## Decision / readiness
- Ready for execution — the referenced sources supply sufficient context to draft the use case catalogue without
  further research.

## Next steps
- Draft the execution use case catalogue under `context/roadmap/`.
- Update the task dossier with a constraint summary and source references.
