| ID | Title | Status | Stage | Goal | Constraints | Dossier | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ICLI-001 | Establish assistant-managed task workflow | Done | Done | Provide a repeatable structure for defining, analysing, researching, and executing tasks without an external tracker. | Workflow must cover planning, analysis, optional research, and execution phases with clear logging expectations. | [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-001/README.md](archive/ICLI-001/README.md) | Archived 2025-10-17; workflow live in context/tasks/README.md. |
| ICLI-002 | Consolidate execution requirements | Done | Done | Map functional and non-functional requirements for single-run, interactive, and pooled process modes. | Capture maintainer use cases and document cross-platform constraints ahead of architecture work. | [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-002/README.md](archive/ICLI-002/README.md) | Completed 2025-10-18; archived after publishing execution requirements brief. |
| ICLI-003 | Catalogue execution use cases & constraints | Done | Done | Document maintainer-sourced execution scenarios and cross-platform constraints to inform architecture work. | Use existing audits and knowledge base; defer new research unless gaps emerge. | [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-003/README.md](archive/ICLI-003/README.md) | Archived 2025-10-18; supports roadmap Phase 2 discovery effort. |
| ICLI-004 | Outline process execution architecture | Done | Done | Draft high-level architecture for single-run, interactive, and pooled execution components. | Align with execution requirements brief and existing knowledge base guidance. | [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-004/README.md](archive/ICLI-004/README.md) | Archived 2025-10-24; brief published and API/core alignment complete, follow-up implementation items tracked separately. |
| TBD-001 | Define default ExecutionOptions/ResponseDecoder/ProcessEngine presets | Planned | Discovery | Lock in safe defaults so CommandService can offer short-form constructors (definition, definition+options, etc.). | Defaults must reflect documented requirements (bounded capture, timeouts, PTY strategy) and pass review before wiring into constructors. | — | Prerequisite for simplifying CommandService construction. |
| TBD-002 | Promote ResponseDecoder to CommandService state | Planned | Discovery | Store the default decoder on CommandService and allow builders to override it predictably. | Depends on TBD-001; ensure API remains ergonomic for custom decoders. | — | Aligns decoding strategy with service-level defaults. |
| TBD-003 | Design streaming/listen-only client API | Planned | Discovery | Provide a first-class helper for processes that only need stdout/stderr streaming without stdin interaction. | Must coexist with existing LineSessionClient/InteractiveSessionClient; outline life-cycle and error handling. | — | Targets tail/log-follow scenarios discussed during API review. |
