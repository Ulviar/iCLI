| ID | Title | Status | Stage | Goal | Constraints | Dossier | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ICLI-001 | Establish assistant-managed task workflow | Done | Done | Provide a repeatable structure for defining, analysing, researching, and executing tasks without an external tracker. | Workflow must cover planning, analysis, optional research, and execution phases with clear logging expectations. | [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-001/README.md](archive/ICLI-001/README.md) | Archived 2025-10-17; workflow live in context/tasks/README.md. |
| ICLI-002 | Consolidate execution requirements | Done | Done | Map functional and non-functional requirements for single-run, interactive, and pooled process modes. | Capture maintainer use cases and document cross-platform constraints ahead of architecture work. | [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-002/README.md](archive/ICLI-002/README.md) | Completed 2025-10-18; archived after publishing execution requirements brief. |
| ICLI-003 | Catalogue execution use cases & constraints | Backlog | Planning | Document maintainer-sourced execution scenarios and cross-platform constraints to inform architecture work. | Use existing audits and knowledge base; defer new research unless gaps emerge. | [context/tasks/ICLI-003/README.md](ICLI-003/README.md) | Supports roadmap Phase 2 discovery effort. |
| ICLI-004 | Outline process execution architecture | Backlog | Planning | Draft high-level architecture for single-run, interactive, and pooled execution components. | Align with execution requirements brief and existing knowledge base guidance. | [context/tasks/ICLI-004/README.md](ICLI-004/README.md) | Planned follow-up to ICLI-002 and ICLI-003 outputs. |
