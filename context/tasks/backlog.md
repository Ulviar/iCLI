| TBD-001 | Define default ExecutionOptions/ResponseDecoder/ProcessEngine presets | Planned | Discovery | Lock in safe defaults so CommandService can offer short-form constructors (definition, definition+options, etc.). | Defaults must reflect documented requirements (bounded capture, timeouts, PTY strategy) and pass review before wiring into constructors. | — | Prerequisite for simplifying CommandService construction. |
