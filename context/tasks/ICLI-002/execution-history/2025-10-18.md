- **Author:** Assistant (Codex)
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Drafted the execution requirements brief and cross-linked it within the roadmap.

## Implementation notes
- Added `context/roadmap/execution-requirements.md` capturing single-run, interactive session, and pooled worker
  requirements with functional and non-functional detail.
- Updated `context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md` Phase 2 narrative to reference the new requirements brief.

## Tests & verification
- Not run — documentation-only change, no automated tasks executed.

## Documentation updates
- `context/roadmap/execution-requirements.md` — New requirements brief for process execution modes.
- `context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md` — Linked Phase 2 work to the new brief.

## Follow-up & risks
