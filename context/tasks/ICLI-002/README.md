# ICLI-002 — Consolidate Execution Requirements

## Status
- **Lifecycle stage:** Planning
- **Overall status:** Backlog
- **Last updated:** 2025-10-17
- **Owner:** Unassigned

## Overview
- **Objective:** Capture functional and non-functional requirements for single-run commands, long-running interactive
  sessions, and pooled workers to guide upcoming architecture work.
- **Definition of Done:**
  - Requirements brief added to `context/roadmap/` summarising use cases, IO patterns, timeout expectations, and
    cross-platform concerns.
  - Maintainer notes on process execution priorities captured in the dossier.
  - Research registry updated with any new investigations referenced.
- **Constraints:** Follow existing context documentation standards; keep requirements aligned with Java 25 / Kotlin 2.2
  stack; record knowledge sources with relative links.
- **Roles to notify:** Maintainer (project owner).

## Planning
- **Scope summary:** Synthesize current and anticipated execution scenarios from roadmap notes and maintainer input,
  producing a consolidated requirements document for the execution engine.
- **Proposed deliverables:** Requirements markdown file, updated research registry entries, enriched task dossier logs.
- **Open questions / risks:** Need to surface legacy use cases from prior audits; ensure coverage of both PTY and
  non-PTY scenarios.
