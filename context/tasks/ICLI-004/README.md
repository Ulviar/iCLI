# ICLI-004 — Outline Process Execution Architecture

## Status
- **Lifecycle stage:** Planning
- **Overall status:** Backlog
- **Last updated:** 2025-10-18
- **Owner:** Unassigned

## Overview
- **Objective:** Draft the high-level architecture for the iCLI execution engine covering single-run, interactive, and
  pooled workflows.
- **Definition of Done:** Architecture brief added to `context/roadmap/`; component responsibilities and integration
  points documented; dependencies or open design questions logged in the dossier.
- **Constraints:** Align with the execution requirements brief, knowledge base guidance, and Java 25 / Kotlin 2.2.20
  stack.
- **Roles to notify:** Maintainer (project owner).

## Planning
- **Scope summary:** Define key modules (command spec, execution engine, session handling, pooling) and their
  interactions, including PTY integration strategy.
- **Proposed deliverables:** Architecture document; updated roadmap or diagrams; list of follow-up implementation
  tasks.
- **Open questions / risks:** Pending use case catalogue may surface new constraints; PTY library selection could impact
  design choices.
