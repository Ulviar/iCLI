# Execution Log — ICLI-031 — 2025-11-05

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Extended the pooled client integration suite to exercise the new process fixture (stateless requests,
  failure recovery, concurrent workers, conversation config overrides, and listen-only streaming) and added reusable
  helpers for launching the fixture from tests.

## Work log
1. **Fixture command helpers.** Added `JavaCommandBuilder` plus `ProcessFixtureCommand` so integration tests can launch
   both the existing `TestProcess` and the standalone fixture with identical classpath wiring; updated
   `TestProcessCommand` to reuse the shared builder.
2. **Pooled client + fixture coverage.** Augmented `ProcessPoolClientIntegrationTest` with a fixture-aware response
   decoder, new listener assertions, and coverage for hang recovery, multi-worker concurrency, conversation
   configuration/resets, and listen-only streaming via `ServiceConversation` + `ListenOnlySessionClient`.
3. **Streaming + diagnostics follow-ups.** Added pause/resume streaming verification (with STOP) and a timeout-focused
   diagnostics test that asserts `ServiceProcessingException` propagation through the pool’s diagnostics listener.

## Validation
- `./gradlew spotlessApply`
- `./gradlew integrationTest`
- `./gradlew test`
