# Execution History — ICLI-014 — 2025-10-28

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Drafted the process pool architecture specification and linked it from the execution architecture brief.

## Implementation notes
- Added `context/roadmap/process-pool-architecture.md` documenting ProcessPool/WorkerLease APIs, configuration knobs,
  lifecycle, failure handling, diagnostics, and open questions.
- Updated `context/roadmap/execution-architecture-brief.md` to reference the new detailed design document.

## Tests & verification
- No automated builds required for documentation-only change; repository checks will run before task completion.

## Documentation updates
- `context/roadmap/process-pool-architecture.md` — new architecture spec.
- `context/roadmap/execution-architecture-brief.md` — added pointer to the spec.

## Follow-up & risks
- Outstanding decisions about metrics export and diagnostics integration noted in the spec’s open questions.

## Retrospective & process improvement
- Outputs align with the Definition of Done items covering API articulation and follow-up tracking. No additional
  process
  adjustments identified today.

## Links
- None.
