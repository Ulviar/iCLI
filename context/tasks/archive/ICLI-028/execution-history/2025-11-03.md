# Execution Log — 2025-11-03

- **Summary:** Implemented the `PooledCommandService` facade and pooled runner types, updated `CommandService` to expose
  the new facade, expanded `ProcessPoolClient` capabilities, and added Kotlin coverage for the pooled workflows.
- **Code changes:**
  - Added `com.github.ulviar.icli.client.pooled` package with `PooledCommandService`, `PooledCommandRunner`,
  `PooledLineSessionRunner`, and `PooledInteractiveSessionRunner` plus supporting package metadata.
  - Extended `ProcessPoolClient` to support decoder-specific service processors and listener cloning; exported the new
  package via `module-info.java` and introduced `ResponseDecoder.lineDelimited()` for default decoder access.
  - Updated `CommandService` to provide `pooledService(...)` factories and delegate legacy `pooled(...)` methods.
  - Added `PooledCommandServiceTest` Kotlin suite alongside new assertions in `ProcessPoolClientTest` covering decoder
  overrides.
- **Manual checks:** Completed Architecture & Invariant Review, Documentation Quality Review, Nullability Guard Review,
  Test Coverage Review, Modern API Review, and (latest) Code Smell Cleanup. Each sequence finished with no open follow
  ups; Code Smell cleanup extracted the pooled conversation wrappers into standalone classes to satisfy the
  single-public-type rule.
- **Tests:** `gradle test` (via MCP) — passed.
- **Verification:** `spotlessApply`, `gradle test` rerun after refactors; `scripts/pre_response_checks.py` before
  closing.
- **Notes:** Adjusted pooled failure expectations to align with `LineSessionException` semantics, ensured derived
  services share the underlying `ProcessPool` when swapping listeners, and captured follow-up ideas in
  [plan.md](plan.md).
