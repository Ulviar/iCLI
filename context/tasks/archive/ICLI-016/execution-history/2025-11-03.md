# Execution History — ICLI-016 — 2025-11-03

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Closed documentation gap for `ServiceConversation.retire()`, ensured listener callbacks fire as
  specified, and scheduled follow-up work for integration tests and benchmarks.

## Implementation notes
- Updated `ServiceConversation` to emit `conversationReset` when retiring pooled workers so behaviour matches the
  published callback order.
- Extended `ServiceConversationTest` to assert the revised listener sequence and retire semantics.
- Added backlog entries ICLI-031–ICLI-033 to cover integration testing, multi-worker stress scenarios, and a dedicated
  JMH benchmark module.
- Refreshed the task dossier to capture final status, execution history, and outstanding follow-ups.

## Verification
- `gradle__run_gradle_tests` → `:test`
- `gradle__execute_gradle_task` → `spotlessApply`

## Follow-ups
- ICLI-031: real ProcessPool integration coverage.
- ICLI-032: multi-worker stress and diagnostics checks.
- ICLI-033: performance benchmarks module (JMH).

## Retrospective
- Listener sequencing is now consistent across docs, code, and tests; remaining scope expansions are decomposed into
  dedicated tasks to keep pooled API maintenance focused.
