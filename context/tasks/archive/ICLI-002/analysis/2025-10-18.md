# Analysis Log — ICLI-002 — 2025-10-18

- **Author:** Assistant (Codex)
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Initial discovery pass to gather sources for consolidating execution requirements across process modes.

## Knowledge consulted
- [Java Terminal & Process Integration — Knowledge
  Base](/context/knowledge-base/operations/Java%20Terminal%20%26%20Process%20Integration.md) — Clarified PTY needs, IO
  handling risks, and API expectations to capture in requirements.
- [Project roadmap](/context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Identified roadmap phases that depend on execution
  requirements and highlighted deliverables relevant to this task.
- [Kotlin legacy solution audit](/context/research/experiments/kotlin-solution-audit.md) — Surfaced reusable ideas and
  pain points from the prior implementation to bake into new requirements.
- [Task workflow guide](/context/tasks/README.md) — Confirmed dossier logging expectations that must be reflected when
  updating this task.

## Repository inspection
- `context/roadmap/` — Verified target location for the requirements brief alongside existing planning documents.
- `context/tasks/ICLI-002/` — Reviewed dossier placeholders to plan status updates and future maintainer notes.

## Gaps & questions
- No dedicated maintainer memo on execution priorities exists; will infer priorities from roadmap emphasis and legacy
  pain points, documenting assumptions explicitly.

## Decision / readiness
- Ready to proceed with drafting the requirements brief; no additional research is required at this time.

## Next steps
- Synthesize execution scenarios and constraints into a new requirements document under `context/roadmap/`.
- Capture maintainer priority notes inside the task dossier once the draft is ready.
- Log execution actions and update the research registry if new investigations are cited.
