# Analysis Log — ICLI-006 — 2025-10-25

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Follow-up research requested to evaluate JLine 3 (modern successor to the legacy Jansi tree) as a
  potential PTY or terminal integration dependency.

## Knowledge consulted
- External JLine documentation (terminal overview, provider matrix, troubleshooting) and release artifacts (Maven/SUSE
  feeds). These clarified that JLine supplies terminal abstractions and providers (JNA/JNI/FFM/Jansi) but still depends
  on another PTY implementation to drive child processes; results captured with citations in the task dossier.
- Queried the new `context7` MCP server via the provided tooling; the `context7` catalog currently lists no resources or
  templates and `resolve-library-id` returned no matches for “jline”/“pty4j”, so no additional context7-specific
  documentation was available yet.

## Repository inspection
- Reviewed existing dossier content to ensure the new JLine findings fit the comparison table; no source changes
  required beyond documentation updates.

## Gaps & questions
- Confirm whether leveraging JLine’s terminal abstraction adds tangible value on top of pty4j (e.g., signal handling,
  reader UX) or should be deferred until after the PTY provider is integrated; licensing risk is cleared because the
  maintainer approved using pty4j under EPL-1.0.

## Decision / readiness
- Ready to document JLine’s role as an optional complement (terminal abstraction) rather than a replacement for the PTY
  dependency; maintainer approval for EPL-1.0 removes the last blocker for the pty4j recommendation.

## Next steps
- Update the dossier comparison table and execution notes with JLine evaluation details and clearly state that EPL-1.0
  usage is acceptable while JLine remains optional for prompt-focused experiments.
