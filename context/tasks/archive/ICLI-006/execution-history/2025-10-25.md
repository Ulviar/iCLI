# Execution History — ICLI-006 — 2025-10-25

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Added JLine 3 evaluation per maintainer feedback, recorded the maintainer’s approval to use pty4j under
  EPL-1.0, and positioned JLine’s prompt module as an optional aid for future interactive CLI experiments.

## Implementation notes
- Appended JLine row to the dependency comparison table in [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-006/README.md](../README.md),
  covering release cadence, licensing, provider model, and PTY limitations.
- Clarified that Jansi’s functionality effectively lives under JLine modules going forward.
- Captured the maintainer’s confirmation that EPL-1.0 usage is acceptable and noted JLine’s prompt module as an
  evaluation-only layer atop pty4j.
- Retried the new `context7` MCP server: the endpoint now responds but exposes no resources/templates yet, and
  `resolve-library-id` returned no matches for “jline”/“pty4j”, so no extra documentation could be retrieved.

## Documentation updates
- [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-006/README.md](../README.md) — Evaluation summary updated with JLine data points and
  refreshed Jansi row notes.
- [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-006/analysis/2025-10-25.md](../analysis/2025-10-25.md) — Logged follow-up research context
  and conclusions.

## Follow-up & risks
- Monitor JetBrains’ WinPTY → ConPTY migration plans and create a spike if timelines slip or Windows parity gaps appear.
- Schedule a future evaluation (if needed) to layer JLine’s prompt module over pty4j once the execution engine exposes
  interactive APIs.

## Retrospective & process improvement
- Follow-up request satisfied; broader decision unchanged.
- Improvement idea: capture a lightweight template for comparing “terminal front-end” libraries separately from PTY
  providers to avoid conflating their roles.
