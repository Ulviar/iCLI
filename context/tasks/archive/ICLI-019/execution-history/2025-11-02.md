# Execution History — ICLI-019 — 2025-11-02

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Updated roadmap artefacts and backlog metadata to reference the refreshed execution scenario catalogue
  and created the dossier for ongoing tracking.

## Implementation notes
- [context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md](/context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Added a scenario alignment section,
  phase-specific callouts, Phase 7 audit reminders tied to the refreshed catalogue, and later repositioned the section
  after Phase 5 so completed phases stay untouched.
- [context/roadmap/execution-architecture-brief.md](/context/roadmap/execution-architecture-brief.md) — Linked Essential
  and pooling APIs to catalogue scenarios (listen-only monitoring, stateful conversations, CLI-backed MCP adapters).
- [context/roadmap/process-pool-architecture.md](/context/roadmap/process-pool-architecture.md) — Noted that ProcessPool
  capabilities must map directly to pooled scenarios from the catalogue.
- [backlog.md](../../backlog.md) — Brought ICLI-019 into execution, documented dependencies for ICLI-016, converted the
  listen-only work into ICLI-023, and added ICLI-024/ICLI-025 to capture MCP templates and pooled conversation features.
- [context/tasks/ICLI-019/README.md](../README.md) — Created dossier with planning/analysis details and readiness
  status.
- [context/tasks/ICLI-019/analysis/2025-11-02.md](../analysis/2025-11-02.md) — Logged knowledge sources and next steps
  for execution.

## Tests & verification
- `python scripts/list_changed_files.py` — Confirmed the set of modified documentation files.
- `python scripts/pre_response_checks.py` — Passed; reported markdown formatting sweep and no pending Gradle tasks.

## Documentation updates
- Roadmap briefs now cite the refreshed scenario catalogue and clarify which phases cover each scenario category.
- Backlog notes record dependencies on scenario alignment and future tasks.
- Added ICLI-019 dossier files (README + analysis log) to capture planning and execution context.

## Follow-up & risks
- ICLI-016 remains paused until ICLI-019/ICLI-020 close; ensure pooled API design explicitly incorporates stateful
  conversation needs once work resumes.
- Monitor whether additional roadmap documents require scenario references as future tasks land (e.g., guidelines plan).

## Retrospective & process improvement
- DoD coverage looks good: roadmap/backlog now point to the canonical scenario list and dossier captures progress.
- Process improvement: consider adding a reusable checklist in the scenario catalogue to speed future alignment tasks.
