# Analysis Log — ICLI-019 — 2025-11-02

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Identify how the refreshed execution scenario catalogue should reshape roadmap milestones and backlog
  sequencing.

## Knowledge consulted
- [Execution use case catalogue](/context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md) — Confirmed the expanded scenario
  taxonomy (listen-only monitoring, stateful conversations, CLI-backed MCP adapters) and the concrete tooling examples
  that roadmap items must trace back to.
- [Project roadmap](/context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Highlighted where scenario alignment notes already exist and
  which phase descriptions need explicit scenario coverage callouts.
- [backlog.md](/context/tasks/backlog.md) — Located the current ICLI-019 backlog row and neighbouring tasks whose goals
  depend on scenario prioritisation, informing updates and potential resequencing.
- [ICLI-018 execution log](../../ICLI-018/execution-history/2025-11-02.md) — Captured follow-up expectations from the
  catalogue refresh (roadmap alignment, API boundary clarification) to ensure this task closes the loop.
- [ICLI-016 analysis log](../../ICLI-016/analysis/2025-11-02.md) — Provided context on planned pooled APIs and the
  scenario distinctions they must support, guiding which roadmap sections should reference stateful vs stateless
  workloads.

## Repository inspection
- Verified the absence of an existing `context/tasks/ICLI-019/` dossier and created one for this task.
- Reviewed roadmap documents under `context/roadmap/` to identify sections referencing scenarios only implicitly.
- Inspected backlog sequencing around ICLI-019/ICLI-020 to understand where additional context or status updates are
  required.

## Gaps & questions
- Need to decide whether [process-pool-architecture.md](/context/roadmap/process-pool-architecture.md) or other roadmap
  briefs require immediate scenario alignment or can wait until ICLI-016 execution begins.

## Decision / readiness
- Ready to proceed with planning updates and begin drafting the roadmap/backlog changes.

## Next steps
- Map each roadmap phase and architecture brief to the refreshed scenario categories and add explicit references where
  missing.
- Update the backlog row for ICLI-019 with the dossier link and adjust neighbouring tasks if scenario priorities dictate
  resequencing.
- Outline execution steps in the dossier and prepare to document changes in execution logs once edits begin.
