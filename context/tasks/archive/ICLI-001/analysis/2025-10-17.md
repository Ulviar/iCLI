# Analysis Log — ICLI-001 — 2025-10-17

- **Author:** AI Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Establish baseline understanding of existing guidance before designing the assistant workflow.

## Knowledge consulted
- [Project roadmap](/context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Emphasised that workflow enablement is the current strategic
  priority, prompting the dossier-driven approach instead of a lighter README-only update; surfaced quickly from the
  context index.
- [Markdown formatting guidelines](/context/guidelines/general/markdown-formatting.md) — Drove the decision to create
  concise templates with 120-character wrapping and explicit link formatting; straightforward to locate within the
  guidelines directory.
- [backlog.md](/context/tasks/backlog.md) — Exposed the limitations of the previous columns, leading to the expanded
  status/stage/dossier fields; required manual review but navigation was simple.

## Repository inspection
- Confirmed no existing workflow README or templates under `context/tasks/`.
- Verified [context/guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md](/context/guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md)
  and [context/workflow/collaboration.md](/context/workflow/collaboration.md) reference collaboration processes but do
  not cover assistant-specific flow.
- Noted that the current backlog schema lacks lifecycle fields and links to dossiers.

## Gaps & questions
- Need to decide on directory conventions for logs (`analysis/`, `research/`, `execution-history/`).
- Clarify whether completed dossiers should move to an archive or remain in place.

## Decision / readiness
- Proceed to execution with the structure defined: per-task dossier folders, dated log files, and expanded backlog
  fields.

## Next steps
- Draft workflow README and templates.
- Update backlog schema and existing `ICLI-001` dossier to follow the template.
- Amend cross-reference documents to introduce the workflow.
