# Execution History — ICLI-001 — 2025-10-17

- **Author:** AI Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Documented the assistant-managed workflow, created supporting templates, updated backlog formatting,
  codified the human-in-the-loop research process, and refreshed cross-references.

## Implementation notes
- Refined [context/tasks/README.md](../../../README.md) to mandate Markdown-linked knowledge references and document the
  human-in-the-loop research hand-off protocol.
- Added [context/tasks/README.md](../../../README.md) describing lifecycle stages, dossier structure, templates,
  feedback-loop guidance, and the archive strategy for completed dossiers.
- Created templates for dossiers, analysis logs, research requests, and execution histories under
  `context/tasks/templates/`.
- Introduced example dossier and logs in `context/tasks/examples/sample-task/`.
- Updated [backlog.md](/context/tasks/backlog.md) schema and migrated the ICLI-001 row to the new format.
- Converted the ICLI-001 dossier to the template-based structure with analysis and execution logs.
- Linked the workflow from [context/README.md](../../../../README.md), contributor guidelines, and collaboration
  workflow documentation.
- Added [context/tasks/archive/README.md](../../README.md) and template sections documenting the archival checklist.

## Tests & verification
- Manual review of Markdown formatting and internal links.

## Documentation updates
- Multiple Markdown files across `context/tasks/`, [context/README.md](../../../../README.md),
  [context/guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md](../../../../guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md), and
  [context/workflow/collaboration.md](../../../../workflow/collaboration.md).

## Follow-up & risks
- No outstanding follow-up; future tasks should validate the workflow during use and propose refinements as needed.
