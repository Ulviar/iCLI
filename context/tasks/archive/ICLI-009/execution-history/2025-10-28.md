- **Author:** Assistant (Codex)
- **Lifecycle stage:** Retrospective

## Summary
- Confirmed PTY interactive session deliverables met the Definition of Done and prepared the dossier for archival per
  maintainer request.

## Implementation notes
- Reviewed backlog/task status, updated the dossier metadata to reflect completion, and coordinated archival move.
- No code or test artefacts changed in this session; work focused on documentation and bookkeeping.

## Tests & verification
- No new automated runs required (code unchanged since the 2025-10-26 verification captured in this task’s prior log).
- `python scripts/pre_response_checks.py` — executed to ensure repository status is clean ahead of archival.

## Follow-up
- Remaining observability and Windows ConPTY breadth items stay covered by backlog entries ICLI-010 and ICLI-011.
