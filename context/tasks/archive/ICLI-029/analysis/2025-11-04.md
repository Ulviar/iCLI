# 2025-11-04 — Analysis log

## Knowledge consulted
- [AGENTS.md](/AGENTS.md) — Re-read global workflow + tooling constraints; confirmed Gradle invocations must use MCP
  tools and docs/tests must remain in English.
- [context/context-overview.md](/context/context-overview.md) — Checklist directing which governance, coding, and
  roadmap docs to revisit before touching the task.
- [context/guidelines/coding/standards.md](/context/guidelines/coding/standards.md) — Ensured nullability +
  documentation rules still apply even for doc-focused changes (important for any code snippets we might adjust).
- [context/guidelines/icli/assistant-notes.md](/context/guidelines/icli/assistant-notes.md) — Reconfirmed expectation to
  keep public docs authoritative and derive tests/examples strictly from documented behaviour.
- [context/guidelines/general/markdown-formatting.md](/context/guidelines/general/markdown-formatting.md) — Needed for
  wrapping README/architecture brief updates.
- [context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md](/context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Verified Phase 6 doc focus and scenario
  alignment guidance we must reference in the README refresh.
- [context/roadmap/execution-architecture-brief.md](/context/roadmap/execution-architecture-brief.md) — Identified the
  sections that describe Essential vs pooled APIs; will update them to highlight scenario-specific runners.
- [context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md](/context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md) — Provides the
  canonical scenario categories (single-run automation, line sessions, listen-only, MCP adapters, pooled conversations)
  we must mirror in examples.
- [context/knowledge-base/operations/Java Terminal & Process
  Integration.md](/context/knowledge-base/operations/Java%20Terminal%20%26%20Process%20Integration.md) — Supplies
  operational nuances (PTY vs pipe) that influence scenario documentation.
- [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-026/design/2025-11-03-pooled-command-service.md](../../ICLI-026/design/2025-11-03-pooled-command-service.md)
  — Outlines the intended messaging for `PooledCommandService` and future scenario runners; use it to ensure
  README/brief stay consistent.
- [README.md](/README.md) — Audited current quick-start sections; found the missing “Script expect-style interactions”
  content and lack of scenario mapping between standard/pooled runners.

## Findings / decisions
- Current README highlights single-run and REPL flows but omits the expect-style example entirely and barely mentions
  pooled scenarios; needs new scenario table plus cross-links to `PooledCommandService`.
- Architecture brief still frames pooled helpers as a simple branch; it should explicitly describe how scenario runners
  map to the refreshed catalogue and call out future listen-only/stateful helpers.
- Backlog row for ICLI-029 still lacks a dossier link; update alongside documentation work.

## Readiness decision
Ready to enter execution: scope is limited to documentation/metadata updates (README, architecture brief, backlog row,
dossier logs) with no code changes anticipated. Will still follow TDD expectations if implementation scope expands.
