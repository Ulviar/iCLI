# Execution History — ICLI-029 — 2025-11-04

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Documented how standard and pooled runners map to execution scenarios, refreshed README examples, and
  updated the architecture brief/backlog metadata.

## Implementation notes
- README.md — Added the missing `LineExpect` example, introduced a scenario cheat sheet mapping each catalogue scenario
  to `CommandService`/`PooledCommandService` helpers, and clarified advanced pooled usage.
- context/roadmap/execution-architecture-brief.md — Expanded the Essential API section with scenario coverage, future
  listen-only/MCP helper references, and reiterated that the README cheat sheet is the consumer-facing guide.
- context/tasks/backlog.md / context/tasks/ICLI-029/README.md / analysis log — Created the active dossier, marked the
  backlog row as `Active → Execution`, and captured the analysis references.

## Tests & verification
- `python scripts/pre_response_checks.py` — Passed (ran multiple times per session completion checklist to confirm
  status, Markdown formatting, and `.commit-message` presence).
- Session completion checklist (context/checklists/session-completion.md) satisfied via the steps above; no Gradle runs
  were required because only Markdown files changed.

## Documentation updates
- README quick-start examples now cover expect-style workflows and pooled helpers explicitly.
- Architecture brief now discusses scenario alignment and upcoming listen-only/MCP runners.
- Backlog + dossier entries reflect the active state of ICLI-029.

## Follow-up & risks
- Actual listen-only and MCP-specific helpers still tracked under ICLI-023/ICLI-024; revisit docs once those land.
- Scenario presets (TBD-001) will need another README/brief pass to capture the new configuration shortcuts.

## Retrospective & process improvement
- Updates meet the Definition of Done: scenario coverage is explicit across README + architecture brief, and backlog
  metadata is in sync. No process improvements beyond “continue using the catalogue-driven table” for future doc tasks.
