# Execution Plan — ICLI-015 — 2025-10-29 (pool-refactoring-5)

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Trigger:** New guidance recorded in `context/research/experiments/pool-refactoring-5.md`.

## Objectives
- Apply the mandatory fixes highlighted in the latest research note (metric correctness, timeout cleanup, lease
  idempotency).
- Assess the recommended P1/P2 refinements and identify which ones to tackle during this iteration.

## Work plan
1. Cross-check the guidance against the current `core.pool` sources to confirm which changes remain outstanding.
2. Implement the required adjustments (PoolMetrics total workers semantics, timeout handling, lease close idempotency)
   and stage any additional cleanups deemed feasible.
3. Regenerate the aggregated pool source snapshot, run Spotless/SpotBugs/tests, and log the execution details.

## Notes
- Optional refactorings (single invariant assertions, diagnostics debouncing, workerId overflow) may follow in later
  passes once the P0 items are secured.
