# Execution Plan — ICLI-015 — 2025-10-28 (pool-refactoring-4)

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Trigger:** New recommendations captured in `context/research/experiments/pool-refactoring-4.md`.

## Objectives
- Ensure all P0/P1 items from the latest research note are reflected in the pool runtime.
- Preserve existing behaviour and test coverage while tightening invariants and reducing concurrency races.

## Work plan
1. Compare the current `core.pool` implementation with `pool-refactoring-4.md` to confirm which P0/P1 items remain.
2. Implement the required code updates (CapacityLedger invariants, PoolWorker visibility, lease deadline sequencing,
   waiter cleanup) and regenerate the aggregated pool source artefact.
3. Run Spotless, SpotBugs, unit, and integration suites; refresh dossier artefacts and the proposed commit message.

## Notes
- Optional P2 clean-ups (single invariant assertions, metric debouncing) remain backlog items unless time permits.
