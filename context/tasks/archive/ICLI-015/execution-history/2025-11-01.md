# Execution History — ICLI-015 — 2025-11-01

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Retrospective
- **Summary:** Verified ProcessPool runtime against architecture brief, ran final build checks, and prepared dossier for
  archive.

## Implementation notes
- Reviewed ProcessPool, configuration, and internal collaborators to confirm alignment with
  [context/roadmap/process-pool-architecture.md](../../../../roadmap/process-pool-architecture.md), ensuring
  diagnostics, retirement policy, queue semantics, and timeout handling match the specification.
- Confirmed Kotlin/JUnit coverage spans pool API, state machine, hooks, and scheduler utilities; validated integration
  coverage against `StandardProcessEngine`.
- Refreshed backlog row and dossier metadata ahead of archiving.

## Tests & verification
- `gradle spotlessApply`
- `gradle spotbugsMain`
- `gradle test`
- `gradle integrationTest`

## Follow-up & risks
- Remaining diagnostics export enhancements track under ICLI-016; no additional risks identified for the runtime.

## Retrospective & process improvement
- Coordinating final verification through the scripted Gradle tasks kept the closure checklist lightweight; reuse the
  same sequence for future task shutdowns.
