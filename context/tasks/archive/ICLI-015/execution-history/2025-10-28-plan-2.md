# Execution Plan — ICLI-015 — 2025-10-28 (Supplement)

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Trigger:** Additional recommendations announced in `context/research/experiments/pool-refactoring-3.md`.

## Task list
1. **Review new guidance.** Inspect `pool-refactoring-3.md` to understand the requested adjustments and capture any open
   questions. *(Status: completed — guidance reviewed on 2025-10-28.)*
2. **Clarify missing recommendations.** If the guidance remains absent, prepare a clarification update for the
   maintainer
   so further work is aligned with their expectations. *(Status: completed — maintainer provided recommendations on
   2025-10-28.)*
3. **Apply requested refactors.** Once guidance is available, update pool collaborators and tests accordingly while
   maintaining existing behaviour and invariants. *(Status: pending — implementing P0 items now.)*
4. **Verification sweep.** Run Spotless, SpotBugs, unit, and integration suites, then refresh dossier artefacts and
   `.commit-message`. *(Status: pending.)*

## Notes
- Recommendations from `pool-refactoring-3.md` now cover timeout scheduling, fairness under contention, lifecycle checks
  for minimum-size replenishment, and signalling hygiene.
