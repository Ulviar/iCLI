# Execution History — ICLI-022 — 2025-11-02

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Established an assistant-focused guidelines overview, refreshed roadmap coverage, and aligned
  contributor, testing, workflow, and checklist docs with the guidelines plan.

## Implementation notes
- Added [context/guidelines/project-overview.md](/context/guidelines/project-overview.md) as the canonical navigation
  map for standards and modularity guidance.
- Updated [context/roadmap/guidelines-plan.md](/context/roadmap/guidelines-plan.md) with current tooling references, a
  status table, and next steps for remaining guideline work.
- Restructured
  [context/guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md](/context/guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md),
  expanded [context/testing/strategy.md](/context/testing/strategy.md), reinforced SOLID/GRASP expectations in
  [context/guidelines/icli/project-conventions.md](/context/guidelines/icli/project-conventions.md), and linked
  automation checkpoints from [context/workflow/collaboration.md](/context/workflow/collaboration.md).
- Authored [context/workflow/quality-gates.md](/context/workflow/quality-gates.md) and
  [context/checklists/guidelines-rollout.md](/context/checklists/guidelines-rollout.md) to capture mandatory automation
  and rollout tracking for assistants.
- Created ICLI-022 dossier ([context/tasks/ICLI-022/README.md](../README.md)) with planning/analysis logs.

## Tests & verification
- `python scripts/format_markdown.py --check <touched files>` — Passed after normalising ASCII and block quote wrapping.
- No Gradle tasks executed (documentation-only changes).

## Documentation updates
- New overview, quality gates, and rollout checklist as described above.
- Refreshed contributor, testing, roadmap, conventions, and workflow docs to emphasise assistant-centric modularity and
  SOLID/GRASP priorities.

## Follow-up & risks
- Track outstanding actions from the roadmap status table (e.g., Windows CI enablement, extended fixture catalogue) in
  future tasks; no additional blockers identified.

## Retrospective & process improvement
- Outputs meet the Definition of Done: new overview exists, roadmap reflects current state, supporting guides updated,
  and rollout checklist added. Future assistants should continue to avoid blockquote formatting that confuses the
  markdown formatter.
