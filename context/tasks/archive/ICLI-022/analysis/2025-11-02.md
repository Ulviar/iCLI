# Analysis Log — ICLI-022 — 2025-11-02

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Establish the source material required to realign guidelines documentation for assistant-first usage.

## Knowledge consulted
- [AGENTS.md](/AGENTS.md) — Reconfirmed repository-wide tooling, formatting, and workflow rules to ensure new guidance
  does not diverge.
- [context/context-overview.md](/context/context-overview.md) — Identified the mandatory reading sequence we must
  preserve when introducing a consolidated overview.
- [context/guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md](/context/guidelines/general/contributor-guidelines.md) —
  Located existing source-structure and workflow language that will feed the unified overview.
- [context/guidelines/icli/project-conventions.md](/context/guidelines/icli/project-conventions.md) and
  [context/guidelines/icli/assistant-notes.md](/context/guidelines/icli/assistant-notes.md) — Highlighted iCLI-specific
  expectations, especially around records, PTY usage, and TDD discipline, to emphasise SOLID/GRASP principles.
- [context/roadmap/guidelines-plan.md](/context/roadmap/guidelines-plan.md) — Confirmed desired coverage areas and
  spotted outdated references (missing project overview, Google Java Format) driving the update scope.
- [context/testing/strategy.md](/context/testing/strategy.md) — Noted current testing guidance gaps (fixtures, PTY
  matrix) that require expansion for assistant usability.
- [context/workflow/collaboration.md](/context/workflow/collaboration.md) and
  [scripts/pre_response_checks.py](/scripts/pre_response_checks.py) — Verified collaboration steps and mandatory
  automation that must surface prominently in the refreshed docs.

## Repository inspection
- [backlog.md](/context/tasks/backlog.md) — Located ICLI-022 description and confirmed the missing
  [project-overview.md](/context/guidelines/project-overview.md) reference.
- `context/guidelines/`, `context/roadmap/`, `context/testing/`, `context/workflow/` — Reviewed directory contents to
  ensure no additional overview files already covered the needed scope.

## Gaps & questions
- None; scope and references are clear.

## Decision / readiness
- Ready to proceed with execution: documentation updates can begin immediately.

## Next steps
- Draft the new [project-overview.md](/context/guidelines/project-overview.md), then revise the roadmap brief,
  contributor guide, testing strategy, workflow guidance, and rollout checklist per the plan.
