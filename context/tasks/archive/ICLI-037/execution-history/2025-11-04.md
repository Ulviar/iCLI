# Execution History — ICLI-037 — 2025-11-04

- **Author:** Assistant (Codex)
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Converted the build to multi-module, added the `samples` module skeleton with competitor dependencies,
  and documented the new workflow plus verification steps.

## Implementation notes
- `settings.gradle.kts` — Added `include("samples")` so Gradle recognises the new module.
- `samples/build.gradle.kts` — Created a dedicated build that applies Java/Kotlin/Spotless/SpotBugs, depends on the root
  project, and wires competitor libraries (Commons Exec 1.5.0, zt-exec 1.12, NuProcess 3.0.0, JLine 3.30.6).
- `samples/src/main/**` & `samples/src/test/**` — Added package annotations plus Java/Kotlin placeholders and a smoke
  test to keep the module compiling until real scenarios land.
- [samples/AGENTS.md](../../../../../samples/AGENTS.md), [samples/README.md](../../../../../samples/README.md) —
  Documented module-specific guidance (non-published scope, scenario layout, `java -version` baseline, contribution
  steps).
- [README.md](../../../../../README.md) — Introduced an overview section pointing readers to the samples module and its
  purpose.
- [backlog.md](../../../backlog.md) — Marked ICLI-037 In Progress with dossier linkage.

## Tests & verification
- `execute_gradle_task`: `spotlessApply` — ensures formatting across root and samples modules.
- `run_gradle_tests`: `test` — runs the full test suite (root + samples); all tests passed.

## Documentation updates
- Repository root README now references the samples module and build command.
- Added dedicated AGENTS/README files under `samples/` to capture module-specific expectations.

## Follow-up & risks
- Future tasks (ICLI-038/039) must add scenario harnesses and the first single-run example; ensure real-tool tests are
  guarded as noted in AGENTS.

## Retrospective & process improvement
- Goal/DoD met: multi-module conversion completed with documentation and verification.
- Process note: consider centralising shared Gradle version constants (e.g., via version catalogs) before more modules
  appear to avoid drift.
