# Analysis Log — ICLI-037 — 2025-11-04

- **Author:** Assistant (Codex)
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Determine the Gradle and repository updates needed to add the `samples` module per the ICLI-036 plan.

## Knowledge consulted
- [ICLI-036 plan](../../ICLI-036/README.md) — Supplies module constraints (non-published, Java+Kotlin parity, `java
  -version` scenario) that the skeleton must respect.
- [build.gradle.kts](/build.gradle.kts) — Confirms the current single-module setup, dependency versions, and
  integrationTest source set so shared configuration can be scoped properly after adding a subproject.
- [settings.gradle.kts](/settings.gradle.kts) — Highlights existing plugin resolver usage; only needs an
  `include("samples")` entry to enable the new module.
- Apache Commons Exec release notes (v1.5.0) — latest version reference for dependency declarations. citeturn0search0
- zt-exec release 1.12 announcement — establishes the current version for alternative process execution.
  citeturn2search1
- NuProcess 3.0.0 release notes — confirms the newest NuProcess baseline. citeturn5search0
- JLine 3.30.6 release notes — provides the latest JLine version to depend on inside samples. citeturn7search4

## Repository inspection
- `build.gradle.kts` — Will remain the main library build; needs minimal changes beyond ensuring new modules can share
  repository access and keeping integration tests scoped to the root project.
- [README.md](/README.md) — Requires a new section describing the samples module entry point and explain its
  non-publishing nature.
- `scripts/pre_response_checks.py` — Already uses git diff to detect files; no hardcoded module names, so no changes
  needed once an extra module appears.

## Gaps & questions
- Need to ensure competitor dependencies (Commons Exec, zt-exec, NuProcess, JLine) do not unintentionally leak into the
  main artifact; keeping them confined to the samples module addresses this.
- Confirm how future CI should treat samples tests (may become optional), but this task only sets up the module so no
  immediate blocker.

## Decision / readiness
- Ready to implement the multi-module structure and samples skeleton; no additional research required.

## Next steps
- Update `settings.gradle.kts` and `build.gradle.kts`, then add `samples` module files (AGENTS, README, Gradle build,
  package annotations, placeholder Java/Kotlin/test sources).
- Declare competitor library dependencies in the samples module using the latest versions gathered above.
- Document the module in the root README and verify Gradle formatting/tests after changes.
