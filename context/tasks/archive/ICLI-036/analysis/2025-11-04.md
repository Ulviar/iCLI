# Analysis Log — ICLI-036 — 2025-11-04

- **Author:** Assistant (Codex)
- **Lifecycle stage:** Planning
- **Context:** Establish baseline knowledge and constraints for defining the new `samples` module plan through the first
  single-run scenario.

## Knowledge consulted
List only the documents or files that supplied new information required for this task and materially shifted the plan
compared with the initial task description. Use relative Markdown links and capture how the source helped (or hindered)
the work, including any difficulty locating it.

- [AGENTS.md](../../../../AGENTS.md) — Reaffirmed repository-wide tooling rules (Java 25, Kotlin/JUnit, Spotless,
  SpotBugs) plus dossier/backlog expectations, ensuring the samples module plan adheres to existing quality gates and
  Gradle invocation policies.
- [context/guidelines/icli/project-conventions.md](../../../guidelines/icli/project-conventions.md) — Clarified
  preferred package layout (`com.github.ulviar`), PTY/process handling norms, and documentation requirements that the
  samples module must follow to remain consistent with production code.
- [context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md](../../../roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Confirmed Phase 6 documentation goals and
  the emphasis on scenario-driven guides, validating that the samples module should focus on ergonomic comparisons
  rather than benchmarks.
- [context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md](../../../roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md) — Used to anchor
  the initial single-run scenario choice so that every example maps back to a catalogued use case.

## Repository inspection
- `settings.gradle.kts` / `build.gradle.kts` — Currently configured as a single-module build; introducing `samples`
  requires adjusting settings plus shared plugin configuration so both modules inherit toolchains/Spotless/SpotBugs
  without duplicating logic.
- [backlog.md](../../../backlog.md) — Verified numbering conflicts (ICLI-031–ICLI-035 already in use) and ensured the
  new planning tasks (ICLI-036…ICLI-039) are captured with correct status/stage metadata.

## Gaps & questions
- Determine how CI should detect optional dependencies for competitor libraries (Commons Exec, zt-exec, NuProcess,
  JLine) without bloating build time.
- Clarify whether documentation updates belong solely in the `samples` module README or if the root README needs a new
  section referencing it.
- Define the preferred mechanism for gating real-tool tests (`@Tag`, Gradle property, etc.) even though Scenario #1 will
  rely on `java -version`, which should exist on all supported hosts.

## Decision / readiness
- Planning can continue; no external research required yet. Execution (module creation) remains blocked until the scope
  questions above are answered.

## Next steps
- Flesh out the planning dossier with scope summary, deliverables, and open questions (in progress).
- Enumerate follow-on work for ICLI-037 through ICLI-039, ensuring each references this plan.
- Engage maintainer for tool selection and CI guardrail expectations once draft plan is ready.
