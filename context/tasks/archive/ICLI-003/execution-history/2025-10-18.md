# Execution History — ICLI-003 — 2025-10-18

- **Author:** Assistant (Codex)
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Summary:** Published the execution use case catalogue and updated the task dossier with constraint context.

## Implementation notes
- Added [context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md](/context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md) detailing
  single-run, interactive, and pooled use cases with mapped constraints and references.
- Revised the catalogue and execution requirements to clarify that full-screen TUIs, window resizing, and visual layout
  fidelity are out of scope.
- Updated roadmap Phase 4 narrative, dossier summaries, and backlog status to reflect the headless-interaction goals.
- Created analysis and execution history logs to document consulted sources and implementation activities.

## Tests & verification
- Not run — documentation-only changes.

## Documentation updates
- [context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md](/context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md) — New catalogue
  outlining scenarios and constraints.
- [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-003/README.md](../README.md) — Updated status, constraint summary, and link references.
- [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-003/analysis/2025-10-18.md](../analysis/2025-10-18.md) — Added analysis log for consulted
  knowledge.
- [context/tasks/archive/ICLI-003/execution-history/2025-10-18.md](2025-10-18.md) — Current execution log.

## Follow-up & risks
- Monitor for additional maintainer scenarios; append them to the catalogue and dossier if new requirements emerge.
