# Archived Task Dossiers

Completed task dossiers move here once their Definition of Done is satisfied and the backlog row is updated to `Done`.
Each archived task retains its original structure (dossier, logs, research requests) so historical context remains
intact.

## Contents

- [`ICLI-001`](ICLI-001/README.md) — Assistant-managed workflow documentation and templates (archived 2025-10-17).

## Archival checklist

1. Confirm the final execution history entry documents verification steps and follow-up actions.
2. Update `context/tasks/backlog.md`:
   - Set the task `Status` to `Done`.
   - Point the `Dossier` column to the archived location (`context/tasks/archive/<TASK-ID>/README.md`).
3. Move the entire task directory from `context/tasks/<TASK-ID>/` to `context/tasks/archive/<TASK-ID>/`.
4. Add an archive note in the dossier’s “Completion & archive” section indicating the move date.

Do not modify archived dossiers except to correct broken links or add retrospective notes that clarify history.
