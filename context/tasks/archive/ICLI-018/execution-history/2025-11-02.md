# Execution Log — ICLI-018 — 2025-11-02

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Context:** Refresh the canonical execution scenario catalogue and reinforce its role in planning before resuming
  pooled API work.

## Summary
- Extended `context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md` with listen-only monitoring, stateful conversations, and
  CLI-backed MCP server scenarios, including concrete tool examples and API implications.
- Added a scenario-alignment note to `context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md` so future roadmap items explicitly reference
  the catalogue.
- Updated task/backlog metadata to sequence follow-up work (ICLI-019 roadmap alignment, ICLI-020 API boundary
  clarification) and removed the redundant task-local `scenarios.md`.
- Documented analysis findings and readiness in `analysis/2025-11-02.md`, linking to the refreshed catalogue.

## Verification
- Documentation-only changes.
- Ran `python scripts/pre_response_checks.py` to confirm formatting and surface outstanding diffs.

## Follow-ups
- ICLI-019: integrate refreshed scenarios into roadmap/backlog milestones.
- ICLI-020: tighten public API boundaries using the updated scenario guidance.
- Resume ICLI-016 once preparatory tasks complete.

## Retrospective
- **Goal/DoD check:** Scenario catalogue updated with new scenarios; roadmap/backlog references adjusted; follow-up
  tasks in place. DoD satisfied.
- **Process improvement:** Maintain scenario updates as part of the session kickoff checklist to prevent drift. No
  additional tooling required.
