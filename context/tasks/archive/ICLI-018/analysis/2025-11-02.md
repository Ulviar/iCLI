# Analysis Log — ICLI-018 — 2025-11-02

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Validate existing scenario documentation, surface how it’s referenced, and plan updates to maintain a
  single authoritative catalogue.

## Knowledge consulted
- [Execution use case catalogue](../../roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md) — Primary source of historical scenarios
  for single-run, interactive, and pooled workflows; confirms prior commitments and constraints.
- [Project roadmap](../../roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Highlights reliance on the catalogue for Phase planning and
  ensures roadmap updates will stay aligned.
- [Context overview checklist](../../context-overview.md) — Verifies that contributors are already required to review
  the use-case catalogue at session start.
- [ICLI-016 analysis log](../ICLI-016/analysis/2025-11-02.md) — Captures the new scenarios (listen-only sessions, MCP
  proxies, stateful conversations) proposed during pooling API planning; used as input for refreshing the canonical
  catalogue.

## Repository inspection
- Ran `rg "execution-use-case-catalogue"` under `context/` — confirmed widespread referencing across roadmap documents
  and archived dossiers, indicating the catalogue already influences design decisions.
- Reviewed `execution-use-case-catalogue.md` structure — existing sections cover single-run, interactive, and pooled use
  cases but lack listen-only/MCP/stateful distinctions added recently.
- Compared the canonical catalogue with the scenario draft recorded during ICLI-016 analysis — identified overlap plus
  new content that should be migrated or linked to avoid drift.

## Gaps & questions
- Need to decide whether to fold the draft notes directly into `execution-use-case-catalogue.md` or maintain a
  task-local staging area that feeds the canonical catalogue.
- Determine how prominently the roadmap/backlog should reiterate reliance on scenarios (beyond current references).

## Decision / readiness
- Ready to proceed with execution: update the canonical catalogue to include the newly identified scenarios, ensure
  cross-links remain consistent, and document the importance of scenario alignment in roadmap materials.

## Next steps
- Amend `context/roadmap/execution-use-case-catalogue.md` to incorporate listen-only, MCP, and stateful conversation
  scenarios with examples.
- Add a short note in roadmap/governance docs emphasising that new API work must trace back to catalogue scenarios (if
  missing).
- Update task dossier and backlog entries once edits are in place.
