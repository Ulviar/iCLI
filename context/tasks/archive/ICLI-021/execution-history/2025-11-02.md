# Execution Log — ICLI-021 — 2025-11-02

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Execution
- **Context:** Automated Markdown link corrections with follow-up formatting sweep.

## Summary
- Added `scripts/normalize_markdown_links.py` and ran it across the repository to inspect Markdown links, normalise
  relative paths, and correct missing parent directory traversals (e.g., archived dossiers pointing to
  `../../roadmap/...`). The script rewrote 20 files under `context/tasks/archive` and one active analysis log where
  links were affected.
- Executed `python scripts/format_markdown.py` to enforce repository Markdown standards after link updates.
- Created task dossier (README, analysis log) capturing scope, consulted sources, and next steps.

## Verification
- Documentation-only change; ran `python scripts/normalize_markdown_links.py` followed by `python
  scripts/format_markdown.py`.
- Pending `scripts/pre_response_checks.py` before final response (will capture status at the end).

## Follow-ups
- Monitor future dossier archival steps; consider integrating the link fixer into session completion checklist.

## Retrospective
- **Goal/DoD check:** Broken links corrected, formatting enforced, documentation updated — task requirements satisfied.
- **Process improvement:** Automate link validation as part of archival workflow to avoid repeated manual sweeps.
