# Analysis Log — ICLI-021 — 2025-11-02

- **Author:** Assistant
- **Lifecycle stage:** Analysis
- **Context:** Ensure Markdown documentation retains valid relative links after dossier archives and formatting passes.

## Knowledge consulted
- [context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md](/context/roadmap/project-roadmap.md) — Confirms roadmap references that must
  remain reachable from archived dossiers.
- [context/context-overview.md](/context/context-overview.md) — Highlights expectation to keep documentation links
  accurate for every task cycle.
- [context/tasks/ICLI-016/analysis/2025-11-02.md](../../ICLI-016/analysis/2025-11-02.md) — Serves as an example active
  log requiring valid cross-links post-adjustment.

## Repository inspection
- Identified archived dossiers under `context/tasks/archive` still containing relative paths such as
  `../../roadmap/...`, which break once tasks move into the archive hierarchy.
- Verified that `.commit-message` and backlog entries reference the canonical catalogue; ensured updates must preserve
  these paths.

## Gaps & questions
- Need a repeatable way to correct existing links and prevent future regressions as dossiers move to the archive.

## Decision / readiness
- Proceed with automated link normalisation followed by Markdown formatting to satisfy the task objectives.

## Next steps
- Implement script to rewrite invalid relative links in Markdown files.
- Run repository Markdown formatter to enforce style rules post-edit.
- Update task dossier and backlog status once corrections are validated.
